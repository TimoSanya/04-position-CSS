        <h2>Long Island Iced Tea</h2>
        <img src="images/long%20island.jpg" alt="Long Island">
        <p class="description">A cocktail that never seems to go out of style. The potent concoction of rum, tequila, vodka,
            gin and triple sec
            finished with a mixture of sweet and sour cola and lemon juice. Tea isn't actually an addition to the drink, but
            the ingredients used predominantly the cola, provide the profile of tea with much more flavour.</p></br>
